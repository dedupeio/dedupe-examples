= Deduplication Library
A free python library for accurate and scaleable deduplication and entity-resolution. 

Based on Mikhail Yuryevich Bilenko's Ph. D dissertation: Learnable Similarity Functions and their Application to Record Linkage and Clustering

Current solutions break easily, donâ€™t scale, and require significant developer time. Our solution is robust, can handle a large volume of data, and can be trained by anyone.
  
== Python Dependencies

* numpy (http://numpy.scipy.org/)

== Team

* Forest Gregg
* Derek Eder mailto:derek.eder@opencityapps.org

== Usage
  > python setup.py build_ext --inplace
  > python dedupe.py
  (use 'y', 'n' and 'u' keys to flag duplicates for active learning) 

== Other Executable Modules

* blocking.py - loads in test data and finds optimum blocking predicates
* canonical_example.py - loads in canonical restaurant test data and trains based on provided known duplicates. outputs precision and recall values
* predicates.py - tests the functionality of defined predicates
* training_sample.py - tests active learning with user input
