# Dedupe Examples

Example scripts for the [dedupe](https://github.com/datamade/dedupe), a library that uses machine learning to perform de-duplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data.

### [CSV example](http://datamade.github.com/dedupe/doc/csv_example.html)

This example works with a list of early childhood education sites in Chicago from 10 different sources.

```bash
cd csv_example
python csv_example.py
```
  (use 'y', 'n' and 'u' keys to flag duplicates for active learning, 'f' when you are finished)
  
**To see how you might use dedupe with smallish data, see the [annotated source code for csv_example.py](http://datamade.github.com/dedupe/doc/csv_example.html).**

### [Record Linkage example](http://datamade.github.com/dedupe/doc/record_linkage_example.html) 
This example links two spreadsheets of products from online stores and links up the matching entries. Each dataset individually has no duplicates.

```bash
cd record_linkage_example
python record_linkage_example.py 
```

**To see how you might use dedupe for linking datasets, see the [annotated source code for record_linkage_example.py](http://datamade.github.com/dedupe/doc/record_linkage_example.html).**

### [MySQL example](http://datamade.github.com/dedupe/doc/mysql_example.html)

Takes a database of IL campaign contribution data, loads it in to a MySQL database, and identifies the unique donors. This can take a few hours and will noticeably tax your laptop. You might want to run it overnight.

To follow this example you need to 

* Create a MySQL database called 'contributions'
* Copy `mysql_example/mysql.cnf_LOCAL` to `mysql_example/mysql.cnf`
* Update `mysql_example/mysql.cnf` with your MySQL username and password
* `easy_install MySQL-python` or `pip install MySQL-python`

Once that's all done you can run the example:

```bash
cd mysql_example
python mysql_init_db.py 
python mysql_example.py
```
  (use 'y', 'n' and 'u' keys to flag duplicates for active learning, 'f' when you are finished) 

**To see how you might use dedupe with bigish data, see the [annotated source code for mysql_example](http://datamade.github.com/dedupe/doc/mysql_example.html).** 

## Training

The _secret sauce_ of dedupe is human input. In order to figure out the best rules to deduplicate a set of data, you must give it a set of labeled examples to learn from. 

The more labeled examples you give it, the better the deduplication results will be. At minimum, you should try to provide __10 positive matches__ and __10 negative matches__.

The results of your training will be saved in a JSON file for future runs of dedupe.

Here's an example labeling operation:

```bash
Phone :  2850617
Address :  3801 s. wabash
Zip :
Site name :  ada s. mckinley st. thomas cdc

Phone :  2850617
Address :  3801 s wabash ave
Zip :
Site name :  ada s. mckinley community services - mckinley - st. thomas

Do these records refer to the same thing?
(y)es / (n)o / (u)nsure / (f)inished
```
