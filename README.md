# Dedupe Examples

Example scripts for the [dedupe](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe), a library that uses machine learning to perform de-duplication and entity resolution quickly on structured data.

Part of the [Dedupe.io](https://dedupe.io/) cloud service and open source toolset for de-duplicating and finding fuzzy matches in your data. For more details, see the [differences between Dedupe.io and the dedupe library](https://dedupe.io/documentation/should-i-use-dedupeio-or-the-dedupe-python-library.html).

To get these examples:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples.git
cd dedupe-examples
```

or [download this repository](https://github.com/dedupeio/dedupe-examples/archive/master.zip)

```bash
cd /path/to/downloaded/file
unzip master.zip
cd dedupe-examples
```

### Setup
We recommend using [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for working in a virtualized development environment. [Read how to set up virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Once you have virtualenvwrapper set up,

```bash
mkvirtualenv dedupe-examples
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Afterwards, whenever you want to work on dedupe-examples,

```bash
workon dedupe-examples
```

### [CSV example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/csv_example.html) - early childhood locations

This example works with a list of early childhood education sites in Chicago from 10 different sources.

```bash
cd csv_example
pip install unidecode
python csv_example.py
```
  (use 'y', 'n' and 'u' keys to flag duplicates for active learning, 'f' when you are finished)

**To see how you might use dedupe with smallish data, see the [annotated source code for csv_example.py](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/csv_example.html).**

### [Patent example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/patent_example.html) -  patent holders

This example works with Dutch inventors from the PATSTAT international patent data file

```bash
cd patent_example
pip install unidecode
python patent_example.py
```
  (use 'y', 'n' and 'u' keys to flag duplicates for active learning, 'f' when you are finished)

### [Record Linkage example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/record_linkage_example.html) -  electronics products
This example links two spreadsheets of electronics products and links up the matching entries. Each dataset individually has no duplicates.

```bash
cd record_linkage_example
python record_linkage_example.py
```

**To see how you might use dedupe for linking datasets, see the [annotated source code for record_linkage_example.py](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/record_linkage_example.html).**

### [Gazetteer example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/gazetteer_example.html) -  electronics products
This example links two spreadsheets of electronics products and links up the matching entries using the Gazetteer class

```bash
cd gazetteer_example.py
python gazetteer_example.py
```


### [MySQL example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/mysql_example.html) - IL campaign contributions

See `mysql_example/README.md` for details

**To see how you might use dedupe with bigish data, see the [annotated source code for mysql_example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/mysql_example.html).**


### [PostgreSQL big dedupe example](https://dedupeio.github.io/dedupe-examples/docs/pgsql_big_dedupe_example.html) - PostgreSQL example on large dataset

See `pgsql_big_dedupe_example/README.md` for details

This is the same example as the MySQL IL campaign contributions dataset above, but ported to run on PostgreSQL.

### Athena example - IL campaign contributions
See `athena_example/README.md` for details

This is the same example as the MySQL IL campaign contributions dataset above, but ported to run on Athena.



## Training

The _secret sauce_ of dedupe is human input. In order to figure out the best rules to deduplicate a set of data, you must give it a set of labeled examples to learn from.

The more labeled examples you give it, the better the deduplication results will be. At minimum, you should try to provide __10 positive matches__ and __10 negative matches__.

The results of your training will be saved in a JSON file for future runs of dedupe.

Here's an example labeling operation:

```bash
Phone :  2850617
Address :  3801 s. wabash
Zip :
Site name :  ada s. mckinley st. thomas cdc

Phone :  2850617
Address :  3801 s wabash ave
Zip :
Site name :  ada s. mckinley community services - mckinley - st. thomas

Do these records refer to the same thing?
(y)es / (n)o / (u)nsure / (f)inished
```
