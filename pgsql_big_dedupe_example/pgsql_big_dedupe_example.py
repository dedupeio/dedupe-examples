This is an example of working with very large data. There are about
700,000 unduplicated donors in this database of Illinois political
campaign contributions.

With such a large set of input data, we cannot store all the comparisons
we need to make in memory. Instead, we will read the pairs on demand
from the PostgresSQL database.

__Note:__ You will need to run `python pgsql_big_dedupe_example_init_db.py`
before running this script.
